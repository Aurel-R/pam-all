NOTE :
======

* This program is still in development. So, it should never be used in 
production environnement. Else, make sure you can take the control of root user 
(with su for example).

* debug mod (with DEBUG flag or debug option) is very verbose. The logs are
saved in /var/log/auth.log

* See the INSTALL file.



Pam_all philosophy
===================
Pam_all has been designed for system administrators to configure the access
to the root privileges. Traditionally, when an user start an admin command, 
he uses 'sudo' to get the administrator permissions. The problem with this
solution is that it creates a single point of failure (all users can have the
root privileges). The various problems of such system can be : 

 INTERNAL :
	- untrustworthy user
 
 EXTERNAL :
	- attack on the system
	- attack on one system administrator 
 
 ACCIDENTAL :
	- error of configuration/administration


Pam_all tries to correct some of these problems by proposing a common 
authentification to an administrators group (based on a quorum). Now when an
user execute a sudo command, it will not be executed until the other admins
does not validate.

pam_all configuration
=====================

-- create administrator group -- 

INFO : Add an user in sudo grp (in root) -> usermod -a -G sudo <UserName> (for each 
members of administrator group)

	1. create in root /etc/security/pam_all.d/groups file
	2. chmod 600 /etc/security/pam_all.d/groups
	3. edit file : (a special application will be developed to edit this 
		       file)
		
		Groups file have to be like the file /etc/passwd:
		- no space ' '
		- no comment '#'
		- no tabulation
		- no empty line
		
		If an user is set in two differents groups, the first line with
		him shall be kept.

		This file have three columns: 
		1st: the group name
		2nd: the quorum (2 <= Q <= n  (Q=quorum n=number of users))
		3rd: users list (separated by commas)

		Example :
			  admin:2:user1,user2,user3



-- use ---
	
	1. All users must be connected to the server and run the command 
	   'sudo all-validate --check' to generate their key pair.

After that, an user can run an admin command : sudo ls -l

Other users can see it with 'sudo all-validate -l' and validate the command
with 'sudo all-validate <PID>'. When the quorum is reached, the command (ls -l)
is executed.
