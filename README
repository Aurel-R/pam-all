DESCRIPTION
===========

This module provides an authentication system in an administrator group when 
executing a command requiring root privileges (via sudo). The command is 
temporarily put on hold until it is validated by a quorum of administrators. 
This module addresses various issues such as the intrusion of a malicious user 
into the system, threats against one of the administrators, or simply 
administration or configuration errors.

	
INSTALL AND CONFIGURATION
=========================

1. At the root of the directory (not in module/ or all-validate/), run:

	$ make
	# make install

2. Add administrator users to the sudo unix group. You can also create a 
   specific group that you need to add to the sudoers file. 

3. Update the sudoers file with the sudoedit command to add these options:

	Defaults	timestamp_timeout=0
	Defaults	passwd_tries=1

4. Create the file /etc/pam.d/all-validate with appropriate arguments. It is
   sometimes necessary to indicate the path to certain PAM modules (there are
   usually located in /lib/<your_architecture>/security/). You must also 
   indicate the administrator group (sudo or another one if you use a different 
   unix group for administrators): 

	@include common-auth
	auth    [success=1 default=ignore]	/path/to/pam_succeed_if.so user ingroup sudo
	auth    requisite			pam_deny.so
	auth    required			pam_permit.so

5. Update (> +) the file /etc/pam/d/sudo to add pam_all module with appropriate
   arguments (see man 8 pam_all):

>	@include common-auth
> +	auth    [success=1 ignore=1 default=ignore]     /path/to/pam_all.so group=sudo quorum=2 
> +	auth    requisite                               pam_deny.so
> +	auth    required                                pam_permit.so
>	@include common-account
>	@include common-session-noninteractive


SECURITY CONSIDERATION
======================

This module mainly prevents the intrusion of a malicious user into the system
or the theft/extortion of the password of one of the administrators. 
A malicious administrator may be able to bypass the module, so make sure that 
the administrators are trustworthy and that the execution of a sudo command 
really comes from one of them and is done under good conditions.

* Configure ssh key-based authentication for administrators. 

* Refer to the sudoers manual, especially chapter "Preventing shell escapes" 
  concerning 'noexec' and 'restrict' options.

* Make sure sudoers 'secure_path' is correctly set.   

* It might be a good idea to limit the number of processes that can be executed 
  in parallel in order to avoid a DOS attack by generating several thousand 
  requests (man 5 limits.conf). This may be a possible improvement for a future 
  version of the module. 
  
* Beware of symlink attacks. The module checks that the symlinks have not been 
  modified after the validation of the command, but it is still possible to 
  bypass the check.


TIPS
====

* Use a terminal multiplexer (like GNU Screen) when you execute the sudo 
  command. This will allow you to continue working or disconnect from the 
  server until the command is validated. 

* The sudoers file allows you to specify a whitelist of commands that do not
  require authentication (NOPASSWD).
